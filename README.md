Data-Driven Diplomat: AI Buyer Agent

An AI-powered negotiator built in Python for hackathons and competitive negotiation simulations.  
This project implements a buying agent that negotiates politely but strategically with sellers to secure the best possible deal — balancing **savings** with **successful closures**.

Features
- Implements the Data-Driven Diplomat strategy:
  - Anchors with a fair but optimistic low offer.
  - Uses data-driven concession rates to counter gradually.
  - Accepts deals if within budget and reasonable.
  - Politely walks away if the seller’s demand is too high.
- Plug-and-play design → easily add new buyer strategies (e.g., Hardball, Greedy, Patient).  
- Clear conversation logs showing step-by-step negotiation.  
- Ready-to-run demo with a Buyer vs Seller session.
